For the specific case of (sine 12.15), let's use base-10 logs for calculation simplicity:

Operand is divided by 3 each time, until it's smaller than 0.1 so:

(12.15/3^n) < 0.1
121.5 < 3^n
n > log10(121.5)/log10(3)
n > 4.37... 
n = 5, when rounded to nearest integer that satisfies above inequality

In general, time complexity is O(log3(x)) = O(log10(x)/log10(3))
In general, space complexity is is the same is it's a linear recursive not tree recursive?
