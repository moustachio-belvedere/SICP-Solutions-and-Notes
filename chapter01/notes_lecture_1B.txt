Peano addition analogies:

. (Iterative) tail call recursion, two piles, incrementally shifted marbles from one to the other until one hand is empty, other hand has sum

. Recursive, three piles of marbles, incrementally remove marbles from one pile and place in hand until that pile is empty, then incrementally add them to the other pile

. Again, recursion proper as a chain of *deferred operations*

. Reminder, tail call recursion is a recursive *procedure* that generates an iterative *process*

. Key property of iterative process (from recursive procedure) is its complete state, as contained within its operands

. Is memoization equivalent to a kind-of 'stack machine' in converting recursive to iterative process descriptions
