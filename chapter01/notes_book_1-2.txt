Procedures and the Processes they Generate
------------------------------------------
. Procedure as a tool for specifying _local evolution_. What does this mean?

. A recursive process is characterized by a chain of _deferred operations_

. Factorial as a canonical example of recursion vs iteration approaches

. If length of the chain of deferred operations grows linearly with input `n` then it is a _linear recursive process_

. Alternative approach: an _iterative process_

. In general, an iterative process has state characterized by some number of _state variables_, with a defined procedure for state evolution

. Again, in factorial number of iterations is linear in `n` so it is a _linear iterative process_

. Don't get mixed up between recursive procedures and recursive processes!
