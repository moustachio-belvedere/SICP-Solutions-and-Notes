Procedures and the Processes they Generate
------------------------------------------
. Procedure as a tool for specifying _local evolution_. What does this mean? Perhaps, evolution within a scope. Even less clear in the context of parallelised processes.

. A recursive process is characterized by a chain of _deferred operations_

. Factorial as a canonical example of recursion vs iteration approaches

. If length of the chain of deferred operations grows linearly with input `n` then it is a _linear recursive process_

. Alternative approach: an _iterative process_

. In general, an iterative process has state characterized by some number of _state variables_, with a defined procedure for state evolution

. Again, in factorial number of iterations is linear in `n` so it is a _linear iterative process_

. Don't get mixed up between recursive procedures and recursive processes!

. In general, tree recursive processes will be temporally proportional to number of nodes in tree (makes sense), spatially proportional to maximum depth of tree (why?)

. Relevance / importance of Lame's theorem in this context? Not sure I understand the significance of the connection.
