Part A: the only order that matters is which position Mary's withdrawal occurs.

1st:
  ||100 - 50 = 50
  ||50 -10   = 40 ***

2nd (after Peter):
  ||100 + 10 = 110
  ||110 - 55 = 55
  ||55 - 20  = 35 ***

2nd (after Paul):
  ||100 - 20 = 80
  ||80 - 40  = 40
  ||40 + 10  = 50 ***

3rd:
  ||100 - 10 = 90
  ||90 - 45 = 45
