Two serious flaws:

A duplicated reliance on the multiplicands. For example: if the multiplier constraint uses the value of multiplicand 2 (m2) and product to find mutliplicand 1 (m1), so if m2 is not known, and product given, m1 can never be find.

The constraint is fundamentally undefined as the square rooting operation is multi-valued.
