- Enivironments are where state can exist
  * considered as a sequences of frames

- Procedures as objects with inherited context

- EM (Environment Model) is a precise description of:
    * name rule   - for lookup of variable value
    * define rule - creating a new definition of a variable
    * set! rule   - changing the value of a variable
    * lambda rule - creating a procedure
    * application - applying a procedure

- Referential transparency no longer holds

- Symbol is no longer a name for a value,
  it now designates a _variable_ which is
  a name for a 'place'

- What's the difference between an *environment* and a *frame*?
