- EM (Environment Model) is a precise description of:
    * name rule   - for lookup of variable value
    * define rule - creating a new definition of a variable
    * set! rule   - changing the value of a variable
    * lambda rule - creating a procedure
    * application - applying a procedure

- Environments are where state can exist
  * considered as a (nested?) sequences of frames

- GE (Global Environment) is the only env with
  no enclosing environment

- Procedures as objects with inherited context

- Referential transparency no longer holds

- Symbol is no longer a name for a value,
  it now designates a _variable_ which is
  a name for a 'place' in which a value can
  live.

- What's the difference between an environment and a frame?
  * Best answered with a diagram.

E2 -> | z: 10 | -- Frame B

          ^
          |

E1 -> | x: 15 | -- Frame A
      | y: 9  |

The vertical arrow is known as the 'enclosing environment pointer'
as E2 is the enclosing environment of E1.

E1 environment consists of frames A and B whilst
E2 consists of frame B only.

In other words, an environment is a sequence of one or more frames.

A frame as simply a context in which variables are defined?
