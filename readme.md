Notes and solutions for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (2nd Edition) by Abelson, Sussman and Sussman.

Written as part of an SICP book club.

The language used is the SICP flavour of Racket.

Note `sicp` language pragma in files. Also, SICP repl can be used:

`racket -l sicp --repl`

Non-racket files are generally either LaTeX, PDF or HTML files.

Questions not done or partially done are noted in `revisit.txt`.
