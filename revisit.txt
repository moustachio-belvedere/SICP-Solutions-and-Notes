2.14 - 2.16: 'dependency problem' interesting, out of scope of interests
2.72:        algorithmic complexity
2.74:        difficult to test, not bringing much new material in
2.87 - 2.97: fiddly symbolic algebra
3.19:        try with proper canonical algorithms for fixing edge cases
3.32:        not done
