1.14:        time complexity
1.28:        Carmichael test working, but not sure why, didn't follow book tactic
2.14 - 2.16: 'dependency problem' looks interesting, but out of scope of my learning interests for now
2.52:        could do the modifications suggested, also play around with the painter more generally
2.58b:       working but addition doesn't commute in test example, alternative version with full parser works as intended
2.72:        algorithmic complexity
2.74:        difficult to test, not bringing much new material in
2.87 - 2.97: fiddly symbolic algebra, can come back to it later for fun, not essential for now
