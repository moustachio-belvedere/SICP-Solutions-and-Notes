- Pattern -> Skeleton (via 'Rule')
  * A pattern as 'something that matches'
  * A skeleton as 'something you substitute into to get a new expression', an expression transformer?
  
- A pattern is matched against a source expression, and transformed into a 'target' expression by:
  * _instantiation_ of a skeleton, why the term _instantiation_?

- Instead of bringing the abstract concepts to the level of the computer, bring the computer
  towards the abstract concepts and;

  * in doing so, why solve a _class_ of problems rather than a restricted subset from within that problem class in
    a concrete but circumscribed way
