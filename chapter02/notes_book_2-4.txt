- The principle of least commitment

- An idea of adding or stripping information at higher and lower levels of abstraction

- Checking a type and calling an appropriate procedure for that type is called _dispatching_

- Weaknesses of dispatch:
    * The generic procedures at higher abstraction level must be taught how to dispatch on a given type
    * Naming clashes must be avoided
    * I.e. not necessarily easy to add dispatch to new types

- Data Directed Programming! Instead of naming everything, just have a lookup table in which ops for new types can be 'installed'
    * Note use of list for type (defined as an interned string here) so that multiple dispatch could be implemented
