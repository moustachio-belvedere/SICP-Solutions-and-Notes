(Uses canonical answer as found elsewhere online, mine works but is more wasteful than it need be.)

If searching the unordered sets is O(n), searching through all the sets is O(n^2), but that is worst case. Thus, on average encoding a symbol is O(n^2/n) = O(n).

Revisit this, almost certaily incorrect.
