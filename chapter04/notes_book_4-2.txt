Some terminology:

Procedure is _strict_ in Argument X if Argument X is evaluated before body of procedure is entered.

Procedure is _non-strict_ in Argument Y if Argument Y is NOT evaluated before body of procedure is entered.

In purely applicative languages, all procedures are strct in all their arguments.

In normal-Ð¾rder language all _COMPOUND_ procedures are non-strict in their arguments, though primitive procedures may be either strict OR non-strict in their args.
