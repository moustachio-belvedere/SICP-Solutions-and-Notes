432 possibilities WITH Smith-Fletcher criterion but before distinct criterion.

without SF criterion but before distinction, there would be 540 possibilities.

I think we need help from `amb` actual implementation here, but we have not yet
done that in the book. Once we have, it's just a question of using `try-again` repeatedly until we run out of solutions.

However, from the above numbers, it's definitely plausibly that there will be >1 solution with the SF constraint removed.
