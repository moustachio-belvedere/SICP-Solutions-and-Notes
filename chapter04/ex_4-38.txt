192 possibilities WITH Smith-Fletcher criterion but before distinct criterion.

without SF criterion but before distinction, there would be 240 possibilities.

I think we need help from `amb` actual implementation here, but we have not yet
done that in the book. Once we have, it's just a question of using `try-again` repeatedly until we run out of solutions.

Actually, once realizing the Cooper is limitid to (2, 4) as he can't be 5 as that would make Miller's floor impossible, the answers can be manually deduced.

With SF criterion, only possible answer is:
(B C F M S) => (3 2 4 5 1)

Without SF criterion:
(B C F M S) => (1 4 2 5 3)
(B C F M S) => (3 4 2 5 1)
(B C F M S) => (1 2 4 3 5)
(B C F M S) => (1 2 4 5 3)
(B C F M S) => (3 2 4 5 1)

so there are 5 solutions without SF criterion.
