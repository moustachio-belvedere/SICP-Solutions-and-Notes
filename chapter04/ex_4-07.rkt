;; example works and it seems that in general, yes it is
;; sufficient to install the eval clause as above.
;;
;; there are limitations with forward referencing covered
;; by letrec but the exercise doesn't mention that here
;; and they may also be solvable via expression derivation
;; (though I'm not certain about that).
;;
;; REVISITING - I realise that my solution is more accurately described
;; as let*->nested-lambdas but really there isn't much benefit to using
;; nested lets as an intermediary derived expression so I'Äºl leave this
;; as it is..
